1. Clone the repository:  
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Nxrnoob/HackIndia-Spark-2-2025---Team-Arise.git
   cd HackIndia-Spark-2-2025---Team-Arise

2. Install dependencies:
   (virtual environment recommended)     

    ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Install ollama as per you Operating system.
    ```sh
   ollama run gemma2:2b

   Use any desired model of your choice and make sure to replace the current one in the code.

### Note: Make sure to create a folder named Document or Any desired name (needs change in code) and paste all the documents in it.

## 🧠 How It Works

- Extracts text from PDFs, Word, and PowerPoint files.
- Uses AI (Gemma2:2B via Ollama) to rank document relevance based on meaning, not word frequency.
- Generates AI-powered summaries tailored to the search query.
- Any Ollama-supported model can be used, making it flexible and customizable.

## 📂 Supported Formats

✔️ PDFs
✔️ Word Documents (.docx)
✔️ PowerPoint Slides (.pptx)
✔️ Text Files (.txt)

## 🤖 AI Integration & Future Scalability

This project currently runs Gemma 2B via Ollama, but it is designed to be modular, allowing integration with:
✔️ Other LLMs (LLaMA, Mistral, GPT models)
✔️ External AI APIs (if needed in future)
✔️ Hybrid AI Deployment (Local & Cloud)

## 🔒 Security First! – Runs fully offline, ensuring data privacy without external API calls.
